## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Let's explore the variance or spread of our dataset using standard deviation and variance measures. 
```{r}
#First we'll load the dataset
BikeShare_Data
```
Trip duration is a good variable for us to look at in order to understand variation in how customers are using the BikeShare.

```{r}
sd.trip_duration <- sd(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration)
mean.trip_duration <- mean(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration)

print(mean.trip_duration)
print(sd.trip_duration)

```

The average trip length is 11 minutes, with a standard deviation of 14.9 minutes. That indicates a lot of variance in our dataset!

Let's also run the vairance, mean, and sd directly.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
var(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration, na.rm = T)
mean(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration, na.rm = T)
sd(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration, na.rm = T)
```

Our variance and SD are large, indicating that we have both short and long trips in our dataset compared to the mean. Let's check the range.

```{r}
range(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration, na.rm = TRUE)

```

Yep, that's a large range! We probably have some outliers that are impacting that, so let's also check the interquartile range. 

```{r}
IQR(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Much smaller! That indicates the outliers are having a strong impact. Let's visualize this with a boxplot. We'll check to make sure our data is suitable for that visualization first.

```{r}
summary(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration)
BikeShare_Data <- na.omit(BikeShare_Data)
```

Because the range is so wide, we probably need to remove the true outliers in order to have a visualization that makes sense. We'll remove the upper and lower bounds from our IQR in order to do that. 
```{r}

Q1 <- quantile(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(BikeShare_Data$trip_duration, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

#Defining the outlier bounds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Filter out the observations where trip_duration is outside the upper and lower bounds as we've defined them
BikeShare_Data_no_outliers <- BikeShare_Data %>%
  filter(trip_duration >= lower_bound & trip_duration <= upper_bound)

#Check the new data
summary(BikeShare_Data_no_outliers$trip_duration)

```

This will be much easier to interpret. 
```{r}
# Boxplot after removing outliers
ggplot(BikeShare_Data_no_outliers, aes(y = trip_duration)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    outlier.colour = "navy",  # Color outliers in red
    outlier.size = 3,        # Size of the outliers
    fill = "#00FFFF",        # Fill the box with cyan
    color = "black"          # Border color of the box
  ) +       
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Trip Duration (Outliers Removed)",
       y = "Trip Duration") +
  theme_minimal()
```
